# visualCaptcha for WordPress

The visualCaptcha WordPress plugin is at http://wordpress.org/plugins/visualcaptcha/

This repo is copied to the WordPress subversion one, we just prefer git to actually manage the code

## Demo

You can view visualCaptcha's demo at http://demo.visualcaptcha.net. Note the demo is the PHP version ( https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-PHP ), not the WordPress version, but they should work similarly.
